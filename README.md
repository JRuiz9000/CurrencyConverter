# CurrencyConverter
A Tip Calculator/ Currency Converter hybrid produced by Android Studio. It takes in the user input in USD ($) , allows you to apply a tip percentage, and then calculates the total bill. The user also has the option to convert the total bill (or a percentage of the total bill) into four different currencies. The Euro is the default currency and additional options include the British Pound, the Chinese Renminbi (Yuan) and the Colombian Peso. The conversions are not in real time and are set using a conversion factor. This program will be updated at a later time to include conversions using the current exchange rate in real time, as well as database tables using SQL to record each entry.
